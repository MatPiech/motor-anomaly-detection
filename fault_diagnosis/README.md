# Fault Diagnosis in a Squirrel-Cage Induction Motor

## Data

The Squirrel-Cage Induction Motor Fault Diagnosis dataset is described in repository's main [README file](../README.md). Whereas the collected data are available at [zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8203070) and [chmura.put.poznan.pl](https://chmura.put.poznan.pl/s/zwn7VaVgV3FI2ER), and should be placed in a method-related _data_ directory.

## Methods

* [thermovision](./thermovision) - source code of research paper [*Unraveling Induction Motor State through Thermal Imaging and Edge Processing: A Step towards Explainable Fault Diagnosis*](https://ein.org.pl/Unraveling-Induction-Motor-State-through-Thermal-Imaging-and-Edge-Processing-A-Step,170114,0,2.html) that covers experiments based on thermal images. The code is written in Python 3.10 and uses external libraries defined in the [requirements.txt](./thermovision/requirements.txt) file.

* [vibrations](./vibrations)
